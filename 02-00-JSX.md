## **1. Introduction to JSX**

### **What is JSX?**
JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**, and it is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It allows you to write HTML-like structures within JavaScript code. React uses JSX to define the structure of UI components in a declarative way.

### **Why Use JSX?**
- **Declarative Syntax**: JSX is easy to understand because it looks similar to HTML, which is familiar to most developers.
- **Embedded JavaScript Expressions**: JSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions inside HTML tags using curly braces `{}`. This makes it easy to combine markup and logic.
- **Readability**: By combining JavaScript and HTML-like syntax, JSX provides a readable structure that simplifies complex UI designs.

### **JSX vs. HTML**
Although JSX looks similar to HTML, it has some important differences:
- **Self-closing Tags**: In JSX, even elements like `<img />` and `<input />` are self-closing tags, unlike HTML which can allow optional closing tags.
- **Class Name**: In JSX, the `class` attribute in HTML is replaced with `className` due to `class` being a reserved word in JavaScript.
- **CamelCase**: Event names in JSX are written in camelCase (e.g., `onClick` instead of `onclick`).

#### **JSX Example**:
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In the above example:
- `<h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>` is JSX syntax.
- `ReactDOM.render` is used to render this JSX into the DOM.

#### **Equivalent JavaScript Code**:
Without JSX, you would have to use `React.createElement` for the same task:
```js
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, JSX!');
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## **2. Adding JSX to Your Website**

To use JSX in a regular website (without setting up a full React environment), you need to use a **JSX preprocessor** like **Babel** to compile JSX into regular JavaScript.

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Adding JSX:**
1. **Include React and ReactDOM Libraries**:  
   First, you need to add the **React** and **ReactDOM** libraries. These libraries handle the rendering of JSX and managing state in your application.

2. **Set up Babel**:  
   Babel is used to convert JSX into regular JavaScript that browsers can understand. To do this, you need to include Babel via CDN.

3. **Create an HTML file**:  
   Here’s a simple HTML file where you’ll use JSX:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>React with JSX</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <div id="root"></div>
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.26.0/babel.min.js"></script>
       <script type="text/babel" src="app.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

4. **Write JSX Code in `app.js`**:  
   In the `app.js` file, you can write JSX code that will be converted into JavaScript by Babel. Here’s an example:

   ```jsx
   const element = <h1>Hello, JSX World!</h1>;
   ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
   ```

5. **Run the HTML File**:  
   Open the HTML file in your browser. Babel will automatically compile the JSX and render the output.

## **3. Using Dynamic Variables in JSX**

JSX allows you to **embed JavaScript expressions** within curly braces `{}`. This means you can dynamically insert variables, functions, or any other JavaScript expressions directly inside the JSX tags.

### **Basic Example**:  
Here’s how you can display a dynamic value in JSX:
```jsx
const userName = "React Learner";
const greeting = <h1>Hello, {userName}!</h1>;

ReactDOM.render(greeting, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In this case:
- `{userName}` is a **JavaScript expression** embedded inside JSX, which gets evaluated to display the value of `userName`.

### **Using Functions in JSX**:  
You can also call functions inside JSX expressions:
```jsx
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const element = <h1>{greet("React Learner")}</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### **Conditional Rendering**:  
You can use **ternary operators** or **if statements** for conditional rendering in JSX:
```jsx
const isLoggedIn = true;
const greeting = <h1>{isLoggedIn ? "Welcome back!" : "Please log in."}</h1>;

ReactDOM.render(greeting, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## **4. Run JSX Preprocessor**

Since browsers do not understand JSX natively, you need to **preprocess** it into standard JavaScript. This is where **Babel** comes in.

### **Using Babel Standalone**:
You can use **Babel's standalone version** in the browser to compile JSX code directly:

1. **Add Babel Script**:  
   Include Babel in your HTML file to enable it to process JSX.
   ```html
   <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.26.0/babel.min.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Add JSX Code**:  
   Write your JSX code inside a `<script>` tag with `type="text/babel"`.

   ```html
   <script type="text/babel">
       const element = <h1>Hello, JSX Preprocessor!</h1>;
       ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
   </script>
   ```

When you open the HTML file in your browser, Babel will automatically compile the JSX code into JavaScript, allowing it to run in the browser.

## **5. Create React App Using `create-react-app` Command**

The **`create-react-app`** command is a tool that sets up a **React project** with all the necessary configurations, including JSX support, by default.

### **Steps to Create a React App**:
1. **Install Node.js**:  
   Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

2. **Create a React App**:
   In your terminal, run the following command:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```

   This will:
   - Create a new directory called `my-app`.
   - Install necessary dependencies like React and ReactDOM.
   - Set up a basic file structure.

3. **Navigate to the App Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the React app in action.

## **6. Tree Reconciliation**

### **What is Reconciliation?**
Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the **real DOM** efficiently. React compares the current **Virtual DOM** with the previous version and calculates the minimal changes needed to update the actual DOM.

### **How Does It Work?**
1. React creates a Virtual DOM that represents the UI components.
2. When a component’s state changes, React updates the Virtual DOM.
3. React compares the new Virtual DOM with the old Virtual DOM (diffing algorithm).
4. Only the changes necessary to update the real DOM are applied.

### **Benefits of Reconciliation**:
- **Improved Performance**: React only updates parts of the DOM that need to change, reducing the computational cost.
- **Smooth User Experience**: The UI feels responsive because only the necessary updates are made.

## **7. Assignment**

1. **Set Up JSX**:  
   - Create an HTML file and add React, ReactDOM, and Babel via CDN.
   - Write a basic JSX element (e.g., an `<h1>` tag with "Hello, ReactJS!").

2. **Use Dynamic Variables in JSX**:  
   - Create a component that uses a dynamic variable to greet the user by name.

3. **Reconciliation Example**:  
   - Create a button that changes its text from "Start" to "Stop" when clicked.
