# **React Building & Deployment - Free Tier Hosting on Vercel & Netlify**

---

## **1. Building a React App for Production**

Before we deploy our app, we need to build it for production. React provides a simple way to bundle the app using the **`npm run build`** command. This will generate a set of optimized static files that can be deployed to any server.

### **Steps to Build the React App:**

1. **Prepare the App:**
   - Ensure your app works correctly in development mode by running `npm start` and checking that all components are functioning as expected.
   - Remove unused files, improve code structure, and clean up unnecessary code.

2. **Run the Build Command:**
   Navigate to the root directory of your React project and run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **What Happens During the Build?**
   This command will create a `build/` directory that contains:
   - **HTML files** (usually `index.html`)
   - **JavaScript files** (minified for faster loading)
   - **CSS files** (minified)
   - **Assets** (images, fonts, etc.)

   The `build/` folder contains all the static files required to run the app in production.

### **Serving the Build Locally:**
To test the production build locally before deploying, you can use a simple HTTP server. For this, you can install the **`serve`** package.

1. Install the `serve` package globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   ```

2. Serve the build folder:
   ```bash
   serve -s build
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to preview the app.

## **2. Deploying Our React App to Vercel (Free Tier)**

[Vercel](https://vercel.com) provides a simple and free platform to deploy static websites and React apps. The free tier of Vercel is perfect for small projects with unlimited deployments and easy integration with GitHub.

### **Steps to Deploy on Vercel:**

1. **Sign Up and Create a Vercel Account:**
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign up for a free account using GitHub, GitLab, or email.

2. **Link Your GitHub Repository:**
   - Once signed in, click on "New Project" and link your GitHub account to Vercel. Vercel integrates seamlessly with GitHub repositories.
   - Choose your React project repository to link to Vercel.

3. **Configure Build Settings:**
   - Vercel auto-detects React apps and suggests the default build settings:
     - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
     - **Output Directory**: `build`

4. **Deploy:**
   - Once your repository is linked, click **Deploy**. Vercel will build your app and provide you with a unique URL.

5. **Custom Domain (Optional):**
   - If you want to use a custom domain, Vercel provides free subdomains like `your-app-name.vercel.app`. You can add your own custom domain by following the "Domains" section in the Vercel dashboard.

### **Free Tier Features of Vercel:**
- **Unlimited Deployments**: With the free tier, you can deploy as many times as you want.
- **Automatic Deployment**: Vercel redeploys your app each time you push changes to GitHub.
- **Preview URLs**: Every time you open a pull request, Vercel creates a preview deployment.
- **Serverless Functions**: Although serverless functions are not included in the free tier for heavy usage, Vercelâ€™s free plan provides a good amount of serverless usage for small apps.

## **3. Deploying Our React App to Netlify (Free Tier)**

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is another popular platform for deploying React apps. It also offers a generous free tier, perfect for static websites and front-end projects.

### **Steps to Deploy on Netlify:**

1. **Sign Up and Create a Netlify Account:**
   - Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and sign up for a free account using GitHub, GitLab, or email.

2. **Link Your Git Repository:**
   - After logging in, click on "New site from Git" and connect your GitHub account. 
   - Choose the repository that contains your React app.

3. **Configure Build Settings:**
   - Netlify automatically detects React projects and suggests the following configuration:
     - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
     - **Publish Directory**: `build`

   If you are not using Create React App, you can adjust these settings accordingly.

4. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy Site". Netlify will start building and deploying your React app. Once the build is complete, it will provide a unique URL to your deployed app.

5. **Custom Domain (Optional):**
   - Netlify offers free subdomains (`your-app-name.netlify.app`) for each deployed app.
   - You can configure a custom domain through the "Domain Settings" section of the Netlify dashboard.

### **Free Tier Features of Netlify:**
- **Unlimited Deployments**: You can deploy as many times as you want with the free tier.
- **Automatic Deployment**: Every time you push changes to GitHub, Netlify automatically redeploys your app.
- **Free SSL**: Netlify provides free SSL certificates for all custom domains.
- **Serverless Functions**: The free tier of Netlify allows usage of serverless functions for backend functionality (with some limits on usage).
- **Continuous Deployment**: Netlify allows for continuous deployment by automatically redeploying the app when you push changes to your GitHub repository.

## **4. Handling Headers, Environment Variables, and Other Hosting Essentials**

When deploying React apps, handling things like **headers**, **environment variables**, and **SEO** can greatly improve the functionality, security, and performance of your app.

### **Headers:**
Headers are key-value pairs that control how browsers interact with a website. They can be used to configure caching, enhance security, and set other policies.

- **Cache-Control Headers:** Helps control caching strategies for static files to improve performance.
  Example:
  ```bash
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
  ```

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A security feature that restricts which sources the browser can load content from.
  Example:
  ```bash
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.example.com
  ```

Both **Vercel** and **Netlify** allow you to configure headers for your app in the settings.

### **Environment Variables:**
Environment variables allow you to store sensitive data (like API keys or URLs) separately from your code.

- **Create React App** allows you to define environment variables in a `.env` file.
  Example `.env` file:
  ```bash
  REACT_APP_API_KEY=your-api-key
  ```

You can access these variables in your code as follows:
```jsx
const apiKey = process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY;
```

- **Vercel and Netlify**: Both platforms allow you to define environment variables in their respective dashboards under the "Environment Variables" section.

### **Performance Optimization:**
- **Lazy Loading**: Lazy loading of React components improves performance by loading only the necessary parts of the app.
  Example:
  ```jsx
  const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));
  ```

- **Service Workers**: Service workers help in caching your assets for offline use and improve app performance by serving cached resources.

## **5. Assignment**

### **Assignment:**
- **Task**: Build and deploy a React app to either **Vercel** or **Netlify** using the free-tier services. Your app should be dynamic (using React Router) and should display at least one API's data.
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up a React app with React Router for multiple pages.
  2. Build the app using `npm run build`.
  3. Deploy your app to **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
  4. Configure environment variables for API usage (such as an API key or API URL).
  5. Implement caching headers for performance and use lazy loading for at least one component.
